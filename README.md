### Description of Games

- Glass Bridge

Inspired from Squid Game, users have to join the game by clicking the Join button and every turn just like how blacktea from Mudae bot works, each users will be asked for selecting the bridge and they can react with either left or right and the bot randomly picks the right bridge. Either they will continue or they will loose.

- Treasure Trail

Users are asked to type random numbers in the range of 99 - 999. The person who types the closest number to that random number chosen by bot will get that amount of coins and second round will start. The process will keep repeating and at the end of 5 rounds which is default number of rounds the user with most coins will win.
